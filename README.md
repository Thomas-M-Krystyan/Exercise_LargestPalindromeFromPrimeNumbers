# LargestPalindromeFromPrimeNumbers

1. Technology:

- C# 7.2
- .NET Framework 4.7.1
- Console application (.NET Framework)
- MSTests


2. Algorithms:
Algorithm which consists of:

- Palindrome algorithm (optimized);
- Prime numbers algorithm (optimized);
- Prime numbers product calculation;
- Swapping the largest result (optimized);
- Unit tests for each algorithms (optimized).


3. Business requirements:

- Return the product (and its multipliers),
- of two large (e.g. 5-digit) prime numbers,
- which result (product) is the palindrome,
- the largest possible,
- make the solution as optimal as possible,
- add unit tests (e.g. MSTests or NUnit),
- remember about clean code,
- and production quality.
